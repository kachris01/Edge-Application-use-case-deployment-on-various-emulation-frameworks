# Marvis [![Github Actions CI](https://github.com/diselab/marvis/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/diselab/marvis/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Marvis is a hybrid testbed for evaluating distributed IoT applications.
It can combine real hardware and virtualized nodes in a co-simulation, featuring the network simulator [ns-3](https://nsnam.org) and other domain-specific simulators (currently included is the traffic simulator [SUMO](https://sumo.dlr.de)).
For more information on the idea behind Marvis, please refer to our publication [Towards a Staging Environment for the Internet of Things](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10697.pdf).

It is recommended to run Marvis using our pre-built docker image.
If you don't want to use the recommended setup, Marvis can also be installed directly on your machine and has so far been tested with **Debian 10 Buster**, **Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver**, and **Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa**.


## Prerequisites ðŸ¤–

You need a [working installation of docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/). You can test your docker installation with:
```sh
docker run hello-world
```

## Get Started ðŸŒ¤

First download the project, for example, via git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/diselab/marvis.git
cd marvis
```

To run Marvis, we recommend to use our pre-built docker image (if on Windows, exchange `$(pwd)` with `%cd%`):
```sh
docker run -it --rm --cap-add=ALL -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $(pwd)/examples:/marvisscenarios --net host --pid host --userns host --privileged ghcr.io/diselab/marvis:latest /bin/bash
```

Inside the container, you can now run the `basic_example.py`:

```sh
cd marvisscenarios
python3 basic_example.py
```

You should see two docker containers pinging each other. The ping should have a delay of ~400ms.

Now, have look at our [other examples](https://github.com/diselab/marvis/tree/master/examples)!


## Use Marvis with SUMO ðŸš—

To run Marvis with the SUMO traffic simulator, you first have to [install SUMO](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing/index.html) on the same host as Marvis.

If you run Marvis in the recommended docker setup, you have to start SUMO before Marvis via:

```sh
sumo-gui --remote-port 8813 -c examples/docker/sumo/sumo-scenario/scenario.sumocfg
```

(You can also use sumo without the GUI, just use the command `sumo`).
If you run Marvis locally on your machine, just provide the configuration path to the SUMO setup in your Marvis scenario. Marvis will start SUMO by itself.

To execute the example scenario run inside the container:

```sh
cd marvisscenarios
python3 sumo_example.py
```
